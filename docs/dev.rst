Developer's guide
=================
Before proceeding it is highly advisable to learn C++11  and read `open62541 documentation <https://open62541.org/doc/current>`_ especially :DataTypes: and ::Tutorials:: sections. Part of the ELITPC dcs classes act as wrappers for open62541 so you shouldn't have to call services yourself

If you wish to use config files or add profiles to your devices then you should also have a look at `nlohmann::json <https://github.com/nlohmann/json>`_ library.
